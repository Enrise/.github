# About Enrise

At Enrise we like to find solutions for challenging applications, for companies and ideas in which we believe. We stand for autonomy, craftsmanship and a culture of trust. For the last 20+ years we found out that we want to advance, grow and get the best out of ourselves as individuals, for our company and our customers.

### We love open source

We are strong advocates of open source software, and have been building projects with it for as long as we exist.
This is why we try to give back to the community, by pull requests with fixes or features, and by sponsorships.
On the right side you can see who we are currently sponsoring -->.

### We build apps
We build apps as an MVP or immediately into a mindblowing Omnichannel Customer Experience.

### We do e-commerce
We have a wide range of specialties with above-average seniority in e-commerce packages, frameworks, SaaS platforms or hybrids.

### About our web development
For us, web development starts with independent advice. For our senior developers, customization is the ultimate challenge.
